# Base Migration Tool

The Base Migration Tool is a comprehensive solution designed for projects looking to migrate their ERC20 tokens to the Base blockchain. This tool simplifies the migration process, ensuring a smooth transition to Base, a highly scalable and developer-friendly blockchain. It automates critical steps, including the deployment of a canonical bridged ERC20 token to Base, managing pull requests for token metadata updates, and submitting metadata to prominent blockchain explorers and data aggregators.

## Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Automatically deploys a canonical bridged version of your ERC20 token to the Base blockchain, ensuring compatibility and seamless integration.
- **Metadata Management**: Opens pull requests with updated token metadata to the Superchain token list repository, facilitating the visibility and recognition of your token within the ecosystem.
- **Metadata Submission**: Submits your token's metadata to leading blockchain explorers and data aggregators such as Etherscan, Blockscout, and CoinGecko, enhancing your token's accessibility and credibility.

## Tasks

- [x] **Token Contract Development**: Design and implement the smart contract for the token, ensuring it meets the ERC20 Base standard bridge contract
- [x] **Migrate from foundry to hardhat**
- [ ] **Token Repository Integration**: Implement backend APIs that automate the process of creating and submitting pull requests to the Optimism token list repository.
- [ ] **Metadata Distribution System**: Create backend services that automate the submission of the token's metadata to major blockchain explorers and data aggregators such as Etherscan, Blockscout, and CoinGecko.
- [ ] **Implement Frontend app**
